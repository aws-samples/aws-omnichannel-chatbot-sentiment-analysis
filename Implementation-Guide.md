## Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex: Better Together

#### Deliver Omnichannel Customer Experiences with Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Enabled Contact Centers and Natural Language Processing (NLP) Chatbots – All Backed by Customer Sentiment Analysis

###### When is the last time you, as a customer, consumed a service or purchased a product? Did you interact with the service or product digitally or in-person? What if you had the flexibility to engage through multiple preferred channels (voice calls, digital chatbots, web-based interaction)? Your modern business is expected to deliver an omnichannel customer experience that unifies customer interactions across multiple channels into one seamless customer journey. Within Banking and Mortgage verticals, an omnichannel customer experience entails users availing all banking operations from a website, mobile application, physical branch location, call center, and other available channels, while context is maintained across all customer associations.

###### Iterating further on the seamless customer journey concept, you can derive customer sentiment from customer interconnections across your platforms. By identifying and extracting the relevant call and chat logs, website dwell times, and other pertinent source material, you develop a deep understanding of customer sentiment towards your services, products, employees, and more broadly, your brand, allowing you to iteratively improve the overall experience for your customers.

###### With Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex, you are able to offer your customers the flexible user experience they desire while maintaining a holistic view of their cross-platform engagement. By enabling customers with a self-service capability, you maximize the productivity of your call agents and skills-based worker types while also minimizing the operational costs associated with human workforce supply.

#### Omnichannel User Interface Overview:

###### Once you navigate to the Mortgage Lender/Retail Bank’s AWS Amplify-powered website, you will see the below home screen with your Amazon Lex chatbot embedded within the bottom-right of your screen. The Amazon Lex chatbot then prompts the user for their 4-digit PIN before beginning to fulfill user intents. Let’s get started by building our Amazon Lex chatbot!

#### AWS Amplify website with embedded Amazon Lex chatbot:

#### 2-Part Omnichannel Deployment Process:
   
 1. Provision backend services through AWS CloudFormation 
 > (AWS Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kendra, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3).

 2. Import your Amazon Lex chatbot then integrate with Amazon Connect, Twilio SMS, and Slack.

#### The below architecture diagram illustrates your resultant solution architecture following the above deployment process:

#### Deployment Part-1: Provisioning backend services through AWS CloudFormation 
> (AWS Amplify, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kendra, and AWS Lambda).

#### What are you deploying?

###### In Part-1 of your application architecture, you will build an Amazon Lex chatbot that understands customers' speech and text inputs. Your chatbot is embedded within a website created using AWS Amplify which is connected to the source repository that hosts our HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code. Data about available plans and users’ chosen plans are persisted in Amazon DynamoDB. AWS Lambda functions are triggered by Amazon Lex to execute business logic and interact with the database layer to query pertinent customer data and fulfill customer requests. Amazon Kendra also allows our chatbot to query against an indexed FAQ document so customers and call center agents can quickly find answers. You can also connect the Amazon Lex chatbot with Twilio SMS and Amazon Connect, which allows users to interact with your chatbot over SMS text messages and call your customer service number and interact with Amazon Lex’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR).

#### AWS CloudFormation Launch Instructions:

 1. Select the **Launch Stack** link above.
 2. Enter your _<YOUR_STACK_NAME>_ and check all the boxes to acknowledge that CloudFormation will create IAM resources.
 3. Select **Create stack**.

Allow CloudFormation to launch your resources in the background; you do not need to wait for it to finish before proceeding to Deployment Part-2.

#### Deployment Part-2: Creating your Amazon Lex bot with Amazon Connect, Twilio SMS, and Slack integration through step-by-step guidance.

#### Amazon Lex Concepts:

- ###### Intent: An intent represents an action that the user wants to perform. You create a bot to support one or more related intents. For example, you might create a bot that orders pizza and drinks. For each intent, you provide the following required information:
  
  - ###### Intent name: A descriptive name for the intent. For example, _OrderPizza_. Intent names must be unique within your account.

  - ###### Sample utterances: How a user might convey the intent. For example, a user might say "Can I order a pizza please" or "I want to order a pizza".

  - ###### How to fulfill the intent: How you want to fulfill the intent after the user provides the necessary information (for example, place order with a local pizza shop). We recommend that you create a Lambda function to fulfill the intent. You can optionally configure the intent so Amazon Lex simply returns the information back to the client application to do the necessary fulfillment.
 
  ###### In addition to custom intents such as ordering a pizza, Amazon Lex also provides built-in intents to quickly set up your bot. For more information, see [Built-in Intents and Slot Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-builtins.html).
 
- ###### Slot: An intent can require zero or more slots or parameters. You add slots as part of the intent configuration. At runtime, Amazon Lex prompts the user for specific slot values. The user must provide values for all _required_ slots before Amazon Lex can fulfill the intent. For example, the _OrderPizza_ intent requires slots such as pizza size, crust type, and number of pizzas. In the intent configuration, you add these slots. For each slot, you provide slot type and a prompt for Amazon Lex to send to the client to elicit data from the user. A user can reply with a slot value that includes additional words, such as "large pizza please" or "let's stick with small." Amazon Lex can still understand the intended slot value.
 
  - ###### Slot type: Each slot has a type. You can create your custom slot types or use built-in slot types. Each slot type must have a unique name within your account. For example, you might create and use the following slot types for the _OrderPizza_ intent:
 
    - ###### Size: With enumeration values Small, Medium, and Large.
    - ###### Crust: With enumeration values Thick and Thin.

  ###### Amazon Lex also provides built-in slot types. For example, AMAZON.NUMBER is a built-in slot type that you can use for the number of pizzas ordered. For more information, see [Built-in Intents and Slot Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-builtins.html).

#### Customer Sentiment Analysis User Interface Overview:

###### Once you navigate to the Mortgage Lender/Retail Bank’s customer sentiment analysis dashboard, you will see the below home screen with a sortable list of your Amazon Connect call recordings and Amazon Lex transaction logs. Selecting one of the call recordings or transaction logs leads you to the subsequent screenshot which shows the interaction metadata, language used, average and trending caller and agent sentiment, call or chat duration, and a graph of caller and agent sentiment throughout the interaction. Let’s get started with our simple 3-step AWS CloudFormation deployment process!

#### Deployment Part-2: Provision backend services by installing code dependencies, creating AWS Lambda layer, then packaging and deploying AWS CloudFormation template.

1.  Install code dependencies:

```
cd src/trigger
npm i

cd src/pca
pip install -t . -r requirements.txt
```
  
2.  Create and upload _ffmpeg.zip_ file to the S3 bucket defined in the configuration parameter _SupportFilesBucketName_ as specified in Part-1 of your customer sentiment analysis deployment:

3. Add users to Cognito by navigating to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home?region=us-east-1) and locating the User Pool that was deployed by AWS CloudFormation in the previous step. Administrators will use these logins to access your customer sentiment analysis dashboard.

   - Go to **Users and Groups**.
   - Add users as required.
